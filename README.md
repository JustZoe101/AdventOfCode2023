# Advent of Code 2023

Welcome to Advent of Code 2023! This is an annual event where programmers from around the world tackle a new programming challenge every day in December. This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2023 puzzles.

## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an initiative by Eric Wastl, providing 25 daily programming challenges leading up to Christmas. Each day, a new puzzle is released, consisting of two parts that progressively become more complex. Challenges range from algorithms and data structures to mathematics and problem-solving.

## Structure of this Repository

- Each day has its own folder, numbered from day 1 to day 25.
- Within each day's folder, you'll find a folder for part 1 (`part1`) and part 2 (`part2`) of the puzzle.
- Solutions are written in Python and include clear and concise code.
- Input files for each day are stored in the respective day's folder.

## How to Use

1. Review the solutions for each day to see how the puzzles are solved.
2. The input for each day can be found in the corresponding day's folder.
3. Feel free to modify or reuse the code for your own purposes.
